This application demonstrates a few things:

1) Efficiently randomize an array of user defined type (UDT) items.  Basically, you include a 
   "randValue" property in definition of the UDT, and any time you want to randomize the order, 
   set this value to rnd() for each   element, and then sort on that property.  Pretty useful 
   for a lot of applications.  For example,    I originally wrote this to randomly and 
   repeatedly select 5-10 items from an array of thousands of members.

2) Includes two quicksort subs which sort the UDT array based on string values and numeric doubles. These
   are based on several different recursive quicksort routines I have seen and collected on Planet.  One
   thing which drives me crazy is that if I want to be able to sort an array of UDT elements on different
   properties, I need a seperate quicksort sub.  Anyone know how to send the UDT property to be sorted
   on as a parameter?

3) Reads text data from an ASCII file(s).  There are definitely better, more efficient ways to do this, 
   but this is pure VB6 code that does the trick.

in this.

To use:

1 - Click on the "Build UDT Data" button and enter the number of items you wish to create.  The listbox
    on the main form will be populated with the UDT items order alphabetically by last name.
2 - To Randomize the items, click on the "Randomize" button.  You can do this over and over.
3 - If you want to re-order the UDT items alphabetically, click on the "Alpha" button.
